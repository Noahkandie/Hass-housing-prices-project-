# Exploratory Analysis and Regression modelling of house pricing
## a) Specifying the Data Analytic Question

To study the factors that affect housing prices using different features that affect the real estate sector.

Create a model that can be used to accurately predict the sale of houses.
## b) Defining the Metric for Success

The project will be a success if we are able to create a model that will allow Hass Consulting Company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.
## c) Understanding the context

Hass Consulting Company is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. This study will study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties owned that was collected over the past few months. We will then create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.
## d) Experimental design taken

In this study, we will be conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to study the relationships between the different variables. Later we will create a number of regression models to try find the most accurate model to predict housing prices
## e) Data Relevance

Our data contains variables that affect housing price and prices of the houses
Definition of variables:
